## A little walk through into the project

This project is aimed at proving home service to custormers who will love to get a peoduct, but will not want to leave their comfort zone.

#
## Aims

The project is aimed at using the GPS technology to ba able to track the seller the very moment a buyer makes his payment for a product and is waiting for delivery.

#
## What's forthcoming and needs to be done:  

I have successfully created the basic Node app with registration and login all working well. More will need to be done to the project, which include:-
* Adding to cart.
* Verifying User Identity:
	- Email Verification: ​ since users give their email more readily than their phone numbers, mails
with verification links can be sent to the user’s email ids. Upon clicking on the link, the account
is verified
	- Phone Number Verification: OTP(One Time Password) : ​ One time password will be used to
verify the user’s phone number as SMS is more quickly read than email. 
	- Flash Calls: ​ To confirm the phone number provided by the user is correct, a flash call is placed
to the user, the app can detect the call received and verifies the user account as genuine

* I will love to include notification to enable me create personalized and targeted marketing campaigns.
